# 🎄 Day 3: Mull It Over

## 💻 Part One

The North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop's computers are having issues with corrupted memory (your puzzle input). All instructions have been jumbled up! The program appears to be trying to multiply numbers.

📝 Program Details:
* Uses instructions like `mul(X,Y)`
* `X` and `Y` are 1-3 digit numbers
* Example: `mul(44,46)` = `2024`
* Example: `mul(123,4)` multiplies `123` by `4`

⚠️ Invalid instructions to ignore:
* `mul(4*`
* `mul(6,9!`
* `?(12,34)`
* `mul ( 2 , 4 )`

🔍 Example of corrupted memory:
```
xmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))
```

✨ Valid instructions in example:
* `mul(2,4)` = `8`
* `mul(5,5)` = `25`
* `mul(11,8)` = `88`
* `mul(8,5)` = `40`

Total sum: `161` (`2*4 + 5*5 + 11*8 + 8*5`)

**🎯 Task**: Add up all results of valid multiplications in the corrupted memory.

## ⚡ Part Two

Some conditional statements in the corrupted memory are still intact. Two new instructions need to be handled:

📋 New Instructions:
* `do()`: ✅ Enables future `mul` instructions
* `don't()`: ❌ Disables future `mul` instructions

⚙️ Rules:
* Only the most recent `do()` or `don't()` instruction applies
* `mul` instructions are enabled at program start
* Instructions remain disabled until a new `do()` is encountered

🔍 Example with conditionals:
```
xmul(2,4)&mul[3,7]!^don't()_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64](mul(11,8)undo()?mul(8,5))
```

✨ Analysis:
* `mul(2,4)` = `8` (enabled)
* `mul(5,5)` = disabled by `don't()`
* `mul(11,8)` = disabled by `don't()`
* `mul(8,5)` = `40` (re-enabled by `do()`)

Total sum: `48` (`2*4 + 8*5`)

**🎯 Task**: Add up all results of enabled multiplications only.
