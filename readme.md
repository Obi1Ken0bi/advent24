## 📜 Structure

The project is organized using Java/Kotlin packages for each day. Each day includes:

1. **Kotlin source files (`src/main/kotlin`)**: Contains the program logic.
2. **Resources (`src/main/resources`)**: Stores input files for the puzzles.

```plaintext
src/
├── main/
│   ├── kotlin/
│   │   └── id/
│   │       └── puzikov/
│   │           └── advent24/
│   │               ├── day1/
│   │               │   ├── Program.kt
│   │               │   ├── Program2.kt
│   │               └── ...
│   └── resources/
